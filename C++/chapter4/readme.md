# Chapter 04: Object Pointers and Object Arrays, Dynamic Creation of Objects

## 4.1 Object Pointers

In this section, we'll explore the use of object pointers, which allow us to work with objects indirectly through memory addresses.

## 4.2 Object Arrays

Learn how to work with arrays of objects, which can be useful for managing multiple instances of a class.

## 4.3 Dynamic Memory Allocation and Casting

Understand dynamic memory allocation and the process of type casting in C++ for efficient memory management.

## 4.4 Dynamic Creation and Deletion of Objects and Object Arrays

Explore the dynamic creation and deletion of objects and object arrays to manage memory more flexibly.

## 4.5 The 'this' Pointer

Learn about the 'this' pointer, which represents the current instance of a class and is used to access class members.

## 4.6 Using the String Class for String Manipulation

Discover how to use the string class in C++ for efficient handling and manipulation of strings.
