# Chapter 06: Function Overloading and Static Members

## 6.1 Function Overloading

In this section, we'll explore the concept of function overloading, which allows defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

## 6.2 Default Parameters

Learn about default parameters in C++ functions, which provide default values for function arguments.

## 6.3 Ambiguity in Function Overloading

Understand situations where function overloading can lead to ambiguity and how to resolve such issues.

## 6.4 Static Members

Explore the use of static members in classes, which are shared among all instances of a class rather than specific to individual objects.
